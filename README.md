[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/meteor/todos.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/meteor/todos)

This is a Todos example app built on the principles described in the Meteor Guide. This app uses the module functionality from the upcoming Meteor 1.3, but everything else should be applicable to Meteor 1.2 as well.

This branch (`react`) implements the UI in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html). You can read more about using React in Meteor in the [Meteor guide article on the subject](http://guide.meteor.com/v1.3/react.html).
