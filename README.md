This is a CoffeeScript port of the official [Meteor Todos app](https://github.com/meteor/todos). For information about the app in general, see the [main readme](https://github.com/meteor/todos/blob/master/README.md). Quickstart: `npm install && meteor`

The point of this port is to demonstrate how to use ES2015 modules and classes, introduced in Meteor 1.3, with CoffeeScript. There are many examples across the app for how to translate various ES2015 `import` and `export` and `class ... extends` statements into CoffeeScript equivalents without backticks.

Within the `imports` folder, the original ES2015 version of each file is alongside its CoffeeScript port. Since `imports` is a special folder in Meteor, these `.js` files are never used, since no code ever imports them. (The former `client/main.js` and `server/main.js` are one-liners that I included as comments in `client/main.coffee` and `server/main.coffee`.) Tests aren’t run as part of the core app and haven’t been ported.

For a single file that showcases most of the examples, compare the original [`todos.js`](https://github.com/GeoffreyBooth/todos-coffeescript/blob/master/imports/api/todos/todos.js) with [`todos.coffee`](https://github.com/GeoffreyBooth/todos-coffeescript/blob/master/imports/api/todos/todos.coffee).
